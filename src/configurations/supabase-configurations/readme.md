# Connect to your project

All projects have a RESTful endpoint that you can use with your project's API key to query and manage your database. These can be obtained from the API settings.

You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `createClient()` method. The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

## Initializing

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = 'https://znxrodmcanvsykxmlxoj.supabase.co';
const supabaseKey = process.env.SUPABASE_KEY;
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);
```

## Authentication

Supabase works through a mixture of JWT and Key auth.

If no Authorization header is included, the API will assume that you are making a request with an anonymous user.

If an Authorization header is included, the API will "switch" to the role of the user making the request. See the User Management section for more details.

We recommend setting your keys as Environment Variables.

### Client API Keys

Client keys allow "anonymous access" to your database, until the user has logged in. After logging in the keys will switch to the user's own login token.

In this documentation, we will refer to the key using the name `SUPABASE_KEY`.

We have provided you a Client Key to get started. You will soon be able to add as many keys as you like. You can find the anon key in the API Settings page.

**CLIENT API KEY**

```typescript
const SUPABASE_KEY = 'SUPABASE_CLIENT_API_KEY';
```

**Example usage**

```typescript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://znxrodmcanvsykxmlxoj.supabase.co';
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY);
```

### Service Keys

Service keys have FULL access to your data, bypassing any security policies. Be VERY careful where you expose these keys. They should only be used on a server and never on a client or browser.

In this documentation, we will refer to the key using the name `SERVICE_KEY`.

We have provided you with a Service Key to get started. Soon you will be able to add as many keys as you like. You can find the service_role in the API Settings page.

**SERVICE KEY**

```typescript
const SERVICE_KEY = 'SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY';
```

**Example usage**

```typescript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://znxrodmcanvsykxmlxoj.supabase.co';
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SERVICE_KEY);
```

## User Management

Supabase makes it easy to manage your users.

Supabase assigns each user a unique ID. You can reference this ID anywhere in your database. For example, you might create a profiles table references the user using a `user_id` field.

Supabase already has built in the routes to sign up, login, and log out for managing users in your apps and websites.

### Sign up

Allow your users to sign up and create a new account.

After they have signed up, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

**User signup**

```typescript
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'someone@email.com',
  password: 'rtiZuAieeCMAKUSyGUHS',
});
```

### Log in with Email/Password

If an account is created, users can login to your app.

After they have logged in, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

**User login**

```typescript
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: 'someone@email.com',
  password: 'rtiZuAieeCMAKUSyGUHS',
});
```

### Log in with Magic Link via Email

Send a user a passwordless link which they can use to redeem an access_token.

After they have clicked the link, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

**User login**

```typescript
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({
  email: 'someone@email.com',
});
```

### Sign Up with Phone/Password

A phone number can be used instead of an email as a primary account confirmation mechanism.

The user will receive a mobile OTP via sms with which they can verify that they control the phone number.

You must enter your own twilio credentials on the auth settings page to enable sms confirmations.

**Phone Signup**

```typescript
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  phone: '+13334445555',
  password: 'some-password',
});
```

### Login via SMS OTP

SMS OTPs work like magic links, except you have to provide an interface for the user to verify the 6 digit number they receive.

You must enter your own twilio credentials on the auth settings page to enable SMS-based Logins.

**Phone Login**

```typescript
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({
  phone: '+13334445555',
});
```

### Verify an SMS OTP

Once the user has received the OTP, have them enter it in a form and send it for verification.

You must enter your own twilio credentials on the auth settings page to enable SMS-based OTP verification.

**Verify Pin**

```typescript
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({
  phone: '+13334445555',
  token: '123456',
  type: 'sms',
});
```

### Log in with Third Party OAuth

Users can log in with Third Party OAuth like Google, Facebook, GitHub, and more. You must first enable each of these in the Auth Providers settings.

View all the available Third Party OAuth providers.

After they have logged in, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

Generate your Client ID and secret from: Google, GitHub, GitLab, Facebook, Bitbucket.

**Third Party Login**

```typescript
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'github',
});
```

### User

Get the JSON object for the logged in user.

**Get User**

```typescript
const {
  data: { user },
} = await supabase.auth.getUser();
```

### Forgotten Password Email

Sends the user a log in link via email. Once logged in you should direct the user to a new password form. And use "Update User" below to save the new password.

**Password Recovery**

```typescript
let { data, error } = await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email);
```

### Update User

Update the user with a new email or password. Each key (email, password, and data) is optional.

**Update User**

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.updateUser({
  email: 'new@email.com',
  password: 'new-password',
  data: { hello: 'world' },
});
```

### Log out

After calling log out, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be "anonymous".

**User logout**

```typescript
let { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
```

### Send a User an Invite over Email

Send a user a passwordless link which they can use to sign up and log in.

After they have clicked the link, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

This endpoint requires you use the `service_role_key` when initializing the client, and should only be invoked from the server, never from the client.

**Invite User**

```typescript
let { data, error } =
  await supabase.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail('someone@email.com');
```
